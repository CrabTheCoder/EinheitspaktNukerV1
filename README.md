# EinheitspaktNukerV1
DISCONTINUED! Download my new nuker, Hydro.
Features:
Mass Unban, Mass ban, Full server nuke
**NOTE**:
Must have Python 3.9 and Pip Installed for it to work! If you don't have python or pip installed, the nuker will simply crash.
**How to run**:
Open config.txt, enter your token in after the **token=** variable. Also set the message, role, server name, and channels to create after the nuke begins.
Then open "Einheitspakt.exe" 
Your nuker should work!
If your nuker isn't working or is crashing make sure it's configured with a valid bot token.


After you run this, open your config file and configure your bot!
After that run Einheitspakt Nuker.exe and it should work!

If you have any problems dm C R A B#1592 on discord.
